# Homie
This is the final project for CodePath University.

# Description

AppName is an app that allows communities to assist the homeless/underpriviliged people around them by supplying them with food, welness items, or basic neccessities at their location.

Users of the app will drop a pin at their location when they see someone who needs help. Other users can view these pins, go to those locations, and help the people there.

# Required stories
- User is able to sign in using email/facebook/twitter.
- User can view all pins placed by other users in a map view.
- Users can tap on pin to view description, name, items, etc..
- User is able to add a pin and provide pic, location (could use current location), and description.

# Nice to have:
- 3D touch to preview pins before opening detailed page.
- We want to make this app really polished so we will be using custom animations and segues.
- Moderator screen to approve submitted pins
- City based leaderboard
- Sharing recent activity to facebook and twitter
